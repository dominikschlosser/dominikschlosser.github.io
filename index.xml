I live in the south of Germany where i am working as a software developer for a little over 10 years now.
Primarily, I&amp;rsquo;m working in the worlds of .NET and Java in the area of web development. In addition, for a while now I have also been interested in DevOps topics such as Docker, Kubernetes and everything that goes with it.
I started out in product development, but have been reorienting myself towards consulting for quite some time. Specifically, I am currently working as a software architecture consultant in the public sector and am recently involved in a large identity and access management migration project for a large government agency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will use this page to structure my thoughts on various topics to help both my future self and maybe one or two of you. There will be technical topics as well as opinions about collaboration, organization and other more &amp;ldquo;soft&amp;rdquo; topics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see where it leads, see you soon!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
